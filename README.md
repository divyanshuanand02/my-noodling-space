## THEME/PROBLEM STATEMENT
### **Theme** : Gamify

Myntra is one of the best E-tail players to popularize online shopping in a huge market like India.
The present interface of the app has a commonly used profile and cart system that has non-interactive style and elements. To make the process of checking your cart and Wishlist engaging, we here serve the idea of gamifying the platform to attract traffic on site . 


## SOLUTION: MY NOODLIN’ SPACE 


A 3D room that helps user visualize 2d cart/wishlist section. The major features:

 **My Wardrobe** - A virtual cabinet to depict the cart items.
 
 **A TV** that slideshows the wishlisted items.
 
 **Surprise daily Mystery Boxes** with exciting offers and deals
 
 **Happiness Gul-luck** which shows points you’ve earned 



## How we built it
After proper planning and analysis, We created the 3D room using mainly Unity, Blender and C#. The user interface has been created based on a colour palette relating to Myntra's base colours and focused on the general aesthetic appeal, so that the user would be encouraged to spend more time on the app.

## Challenges we ran into
Since it is our first hackathon and we were new to this tech stack, we found it really difficult to implement in this short period of time. Nevertheless we are proud of what we have been able to build.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
During this hackathon, we explored many technologies with which we were previously unfamiliar. None of us had used Unity or Blender earlier. However, we persevered relentlessly and ended up implementing the tools in our project!!

## What's next for us
We aim at implementing features such as points earned according to the time spent and add further features similarly.
